Dear Subs Team,

In the last period the dead letter exchange received {{numberOfMessages}} messages(s).

The message counts by routing key is the following:

{{#countByRoutingKey}}
{{key}}: {{value}}
{{/countByRoutingKey}}

You can find the relevant messages in the attachment, but only the first message by routing key.

Happy fixing! :-)
